        <h1>OpenTMP LLM Framework</h1>
        <p><strong>Secure, Efficient, and Scalable Distributed Training for Large Language Models</strong></p>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The OpenTMP LLM framework is designed to meet the growing need for secure, efficient, and scalable training of Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional centralized data approaches for training LLMs often risk exposing sensitive data. OpenTMP solves this problem by combining Federated Learning with advanced Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques, enabling collaborative training while ensuring data privacy and security.</p>

    <section class="features">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Training:</strong> Enables secure local training and confidential inference, protecting user privacy throughout the process.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient LLM Performance:</strong> Optimizes model training using edge AI acceleration, knowledge distillation, and parameter quantization, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalable Collaboration:</strong> Supports decentralized, multi-party collaborative training with secure aggregation techniques to protect data from leakage.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="core-design">
        <h2>Core Design Principles</h2>
        <p>OpenTMP is built on a unique Hybrid MPC Distributed Learning (HMDL) protocol that combines the power of distributed learning with MPC’s cryptographic security. This hybrid protocol ensures that data privacy is maintained during both the training and inference phases, allowing multiple parties to collaborate on training a model without sharing their raw data or local model updates.</p>
        
        <p>Key benefits include:
        <ul>
            <li>Secure data handling with advanced cryptographic techniques.</li>
            <li>Enhanced computational efficiency with the high-speed MPC engine, optimizing both computation and communication overhead.</li>
            <li>Flexibility in deployment, supporting a variety of modes including local, centralized, and peer-to-peer setups.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <section class="example-flow">
        <h2>Example Flow: Secure Training Epoch</h2>
        <p>Here’s a simplified view of how OpenTMP ensures secure training in a distributed, privacy-preserving environment:</p>
        <div class="flow-diagram">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input A (private):</strong> Client Data (e.g., Financial Records) - encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>Input B (private):</strong> Model Weights (e.g., LLM 70B) - encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>FAST TEE & Slicing Engine:</strong> Secure processing of inputs</li>
                <li><strong>Output (public/validated):</strong> Finalized Weight Update - auditable if granted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This flow ensures that sensitive data is never exposed, while enabling efficient, auditable updates to the model. The key to this security lies in the hybrid MPC protocol, which allows multiple parties to collaborate on model training while maintaining strict privacy standards.</p>

    <section class="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <h3>Financial Technology (FinTech)</h3>
        <p>OpenTMP enables multiple financial institutions to collaboratively train a more robust model for fraud detection or credit risk assessment, without sharing sensitive transaction data. The MPC-based privacy layer ensures that all parties comply with privacy regulations while benefiting from a larger and more diverse dataset.</p>

        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <p>In industries like smart manufacturing or autonomous robotics, OpenTMP allows devices to train locally, reducing latency and improving real-time decision-making. By processing data directly on the device, OpenTMP enhances both performance and security in distributed robotic systems.</p>

        <h3>AI Agents</h3>
        <p>For personalized AI agents, such as smart assistants or recommendation systems, OpenTMP ensures that user data remains confidential during training and inference. This privacy-first approach is crucial for building trustworthy AI systems that handle sensitive information responsibly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The OpenTMP LLM framework offers a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for distributed LLM training, making it ideal for industries like FinTech, robotics, and AI agents. By leveraging advanced MPC technology, OpenTMP addresses key challenges in data privacy, model security, and collaboration. With its robust features, OpenTMP is well-suited to meet the demands of both research and production environments in the evolving AI landscape.</p>
