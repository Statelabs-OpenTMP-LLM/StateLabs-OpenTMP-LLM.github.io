    <!-- Core Design Principles -->
    <section id="core-design" class="section">
        <h2>Core Design Principles</h2>
        <p>The OpenTMP LLM framework uses a Hybrid MPC Distributed Learning (HMDL) protocol, which merges distributed training with advanced MPC cryptography. This ensures that data privacy is maintained even during collaborative training, while still enabling high training efficiency.</p>
        <p>The system is designed to handle complex distributed learning environments and scales efficiently with minimal overhead, thanks to its Fast MPC Engine and flexible architecture.</p>

    <!-- Example Flow -->
    <section id="example-flow" class="section">
        <h2>Example Flow: Secure Training Epoch</h2>
        <div class="flow-diagram">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input A (private):</strong> Client Data (e.g., Financial Records) - encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>Input B (private):</strong> Model Weights (e.g., LLM 70B) - encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>FAST TEE & Slicing Engine:</strong> Secure processing and aggregation of inputs</li>
                <li><strong>Output (public/validated):</strong> Finalized Weight Update - auditable if granted</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This flow demonstrates how OpenTMP securely trains LLMs by ensuring data privacy at every step. The encrypted inputs and secure aggregation during processing prevent unauthorized data access and maintain auditability of the final model updates.</p>

    <!-- Applications -->
    <section id="applications" class="section">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <h3>Financial Technology (FinTech)</h3>
        <p>OpenTMP enables multiple financial institutions to collaboratively train models for credit risk assessment or fraud detection without sharing sensitive transaction data. By leveraging MPC technology, the privacy of each partyâ€™s data is preserved, enabling a more accurate and generalized model.</p>

        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <p>For robotics and smart manufacturing, OpenTMP enables local, decentralized training, allowing devices to process data in real time without relying on cloud-based servers. This reduces latency and enhances the reliability of robotic systems while ensuring data security.</p>

        <h3>AI Agents</h3>
        <p>In personalized AI agents such as smart assistants, OpenTMP ensures that sensitive user data remains private during both training and inference, helping build trust in AI systems while maintaining compliance with data privacy regulations.</p>
