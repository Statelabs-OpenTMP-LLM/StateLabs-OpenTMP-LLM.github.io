        <h1>OpenTMP LLM Framework</h1>
        <p><strong>Secure, Efficient, and Governable Distributed Training for Large Language Models</strong></p>
    </header>

    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the AI landscape, but the challenge of data privacy persists. Training LLMs demands vast amounts of data, often distributed across different entities and containing sensitive information. Centralizing this data poses security risks and is not always feasible. The <strong>OpenTMP LLM framework</strong> offers a secure, efficient, and governable solution for distributed LLM training, blending federated learning with advanced Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques to ensure data privacy and confidentiality.</p>

        <h2>Core Design Principles</h2>
        <p>The OpenTMP LLM framework is built to address the core challenges of LLM training—efficiency, flexibility, and scalability—while ensuring robust data privacy and security. At its core, the framework utilizes a hybrid MPC Distributed Learning (HMDL) protocol, combining the decentralized power of distributed learning with the strong cryptographic capabilities of MPC. This ensures that even in multi-party collaborations, no participant can access others' raw data or model updates, completely eliminating the risk of data leakage.</p>

        <p>Additionally, a high-speed MPC engine optimizes cryptographic computations to reduce both computation and communication overhead, enabling training speeds comparable to non-privacy-preserving methods without compromising security.</p>

    <section class="advanced-tech">
        <h2>Advanced Technology Integration</h2>
        <p>The framework integrates advanced techniques like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), knowledge distillation, and model quantization, significantly improving both computational efficiency and model performance. These optimizations allow LLMs to be trained even in resource-constrained environments, making the framework an ideal solution for large-scale distributed training.</p>

    <section class="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <h3>Financial Technology (FinTech)</h3>
        <p>OpenTMP enables secure, multi-party collaborative training without compromising sensitive financial data. Multiple institutions can train more accurate models for credit risk assessments or fraud detection while maintaining strict data privacy through MPC technology.</p>

        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <p>In smart manufacturing, logistics, and robotics, the framework supports local post-training and inference. This minimizes latency, enhances real-time decision-making, and ensures that critical data stays on the device, boosting security and reliability.</p>

        <h3>AI Agents</h3>
        <p>The framework safeguards user data and model intellectual property, making it ideal for AI agents, such as smart assistants and personalized recommendation systems, that handle sensitive user information.</p>
